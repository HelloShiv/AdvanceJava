# Factory Methods:
Factory methods are a design pattern in object-oriented programming where a method is responsible for creating and returning instances of classes. Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you call a factory method which handles the object creation process

# Instance Methods:
Instance methods,  are methods that are associated with instances (objects) of a class. These methods operate on the instance variables of the class and are called on specific objects created from that class.
